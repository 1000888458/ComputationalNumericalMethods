Computational Methods for Astronomy
===================================
by: **Sebastian Bustamante** *2014*

This course is intended for students of Astronomy at the Universidad de Antioquia 
and will cover some numerical methods commonly used in science and specially in 
astronomy. These topics will be addressed from a formal context but also keeping 
a practical and computational approach, illustrating many useful applications in
problems of physics and astronomy.


The practical component will be almost entirely developed in *Python* and 
slightly less in *C* (when computational performance is required). 
However students with knowledge in other programming languages (except
privative languages like MatLab, Mathematica) are also aimed to use them.


In this repository it can be found all the related material of the course, 
including the detailed program, notes and presentations, examples (ipython 
notebooks) and homeworks. (This repository may be subject to changes continuously 
as the course advances).
