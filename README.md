Computational Methods for Astronomy
===================================
by: **Sebastian Bustamante** *2014*

This course is intended for students of Astronomy at the Universidad de Antioquia and will cover some 
numerical methods commonly used in science and specially in astronomy from a formal context, but also 
keeping a practical and computational approach, illustrating many useful applications in problems of 
physics and astronomy.

Almost the entire course will be developed in *Python* (when computational applications are required) 
and slightly less in *C* (when computational performance is required). However students with knowledge 
in other programming languages (non-privative) are also aimed to use them.

In this repository it can be found all the related material of the course, including the detailed program, 
notes and presentations, examples (ipython notebooks) and homeworks. (This repository may be subject to 
changes continuously as the course advances).
