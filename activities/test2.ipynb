      "NGC 5947 is a barred spiral galaxy SBbc located in the Bo\u00f6tes constelation. For this activity, we are going to take an optical integral field spectrum (IFS) obtained by the [CALIFA](http://califa.caha.es/) (The Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area) survey. These data come usually in the standard FITS format (you can download it from [here](https://github.com/jscd/Measuring_Halpha_IFU)). You can handle this format in python using for example the library [PyFITS](http://www.astropython.org/tutorial/2010/10/PyFITS-FITS-files-in-Python#fits-header-keywords) ([installation](http://www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/pyfits/Download)). \n",
