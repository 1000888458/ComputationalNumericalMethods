    "Throughout this section and the next ones, we shall cover the topic of numerical calculus. Calculus has been identified since ancient times as a powerful toolkit for analysing and handling geometrical problems. Since differential calculus was developed by Newton and Leibniz (in its actual notation), many different applications have been found, at the point that most of the current science is founded on it (e.g. differential and integral equations). Due to the ever increasing complexity of analytical expressions used in physics and astronomy, their usage becomes more and more impractical, and numerical approaches are more than necessary when one wants to go deeper. This issue has been identified since long ago and many numerical techniques have been developed. We shall cover only the most basic schemes, but also providing a basis for more formal approaches."
