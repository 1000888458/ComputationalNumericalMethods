      "Due to the discrete (and sometimes sparse) nature of experiments and observations, data taking procedures will always produce discrete data as well. Even, as we have seen before, information only can be discretely presented into a computer due to the binary representation. However, when we are dealing with physical models, continuous and smooth properties are of course preferred. Interpolation techniques allow then to recover a continuous field (intermediate values) from sparse datasets. Throughout this section we shall cover some of these interpolation methods."
