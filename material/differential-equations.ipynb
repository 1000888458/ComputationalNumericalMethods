      "Differential equations is without doubt one of the more useful branch of mathematics in science. They are used to model problems involving the change of some variable with respect to another. Differential equations cover a wide range of different applications, ranging from ordinary differential equations (ODE) until boundary-value problems involving many variables. For the sake of simplicity, throughout this section we shall cover only ODE systems as they are more elemental and equally useful. First, we shall cover first order methods, then second order methods and finally, system of differential equations."

      "Ordinary differential equations normally implies the solution of an initial-value problem, i.e., the solution has to satisfy the differential equation together with some initial condition. Real-life problems usually imply very complicated problems and even non-soluble ones, making any analytical approximation unfeasible. Fortunately, there are two ways to handle this. First, for almost every situation, it is generally posible to simplify the original problem and obtain a simpler one that can be easily solved. Then, using perturbation theory, we can perturbate this solution in order to approximate the real one. This approach is useful, however, it depends very much on the specific problem and a systematic study is rather complicated.\n",
