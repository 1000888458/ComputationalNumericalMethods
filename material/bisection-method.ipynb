      "Throughout this section and the next ones we shall cover the topic of solutions to one variable equations. Many different problems in physics and astronomy require the use of complex expressions, even with implicit dependence of variables. When it is necessary to solve for one of those variable, an analytical approach is not usually the best solution, because of its complexity or even because it does not exist at all. Different approaches for dealing with this comprehend series expansions and numerical solutions. Among the most widely used numerical approaches is the Bisection or Binary-search method.\n"

Below the algorithmm is stated explicitly."
